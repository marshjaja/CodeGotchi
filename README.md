## Description 
This project was created as the final submission for my coursework in the Visual Design and Web Project module at Birkbeck, University of London.<br>
CodeGotchi is a browser-based pixel art Tamagotchi-style game where users interact with a virtual developer character, helping them level up by managing stats such as Energy, Knowledge, Motivation, and Stress.<br> Built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, the project demonstrates the use of variables, functions, arrays, conditional logic, and DOM manipulation. <br>
The game features interactive user inputs, dynamic stat updates, and persistent data storage using localStorage, creating a playful and responsive user experience.

- Centralised Audio Management: Improve sound handling by managing audio centrally across components.
- Dark/Light Mode: Fully implement a dark and light mode toggle for better user experience.
- Random Events: Add randomised gameplay events to make the experience more dynamic and unpredictable.
